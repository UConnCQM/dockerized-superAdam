Seda Arat

=== ABOUT ===

SDDS module simulates the average trajectory for each variable out of numberofSimulations trajectories deterministically or stochastically.

=== RUN ===

perl SDDS.pl -i ../test/test3/sample-input.json -o ../test/test3/sample-output.json

This is a ternary system including iron homeostasis proteins. The simulation is deterministic so there is no need to specify a seed number (-s) in the command line.
