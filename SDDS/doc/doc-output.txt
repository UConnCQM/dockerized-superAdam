Name: Documentation for  JSON output of simulation using SDDS

SDDS returns an output file containing averageTrajectory of each variable in the system; the first number is the state of the variable at time=0. This information is obtained from initialState in the input file. The following number is the average state of the variable at time=1. The very last number in the averageTrajectory array is the average state of the variable at time = numberofTimeSteps, which is specified in the input file.

The output file also includes some information in the input file in case we need them for debugging or using this simulation results in another program such as SDDS_control such as fieldCardinality, initialState, numberVariables, numberofSimulations, numberofTimeSteps.

type: either “stochastic simulation” or “deterministic simulation” based on the propensities in the input.json file.
