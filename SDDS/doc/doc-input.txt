SDDS needs a model as an input which includes the following information: fieldCardinality, numberVariables, variables and updateRules, which must include polynomialFunction or transitionTable.

SDDS is a simulation method with some arguments such as numberofSimulations, numberofTimeSteps, initialState and propensities.

“task”: simulating the model deterministically or stochastically

“method”: Polynomial Dynamical System (PDS) for deterministic simulations and Stochastic Discrete Dynamical System (SDDS) for stochastic simulations

“id”: SDDS - because PDS is a special case of SDDS.

“arguments”: numberofSimulations and numberofTimeSteps are positive numbers. initialState is an array with length numberVariables. propensities is a hash table including an activation and a degradation propensity for each variable in the system. These propensities are numbers in [0, 1]. If all the propensities are 1, then it is a deterministic simulation, otherwise, it is a stochastic simulation.
