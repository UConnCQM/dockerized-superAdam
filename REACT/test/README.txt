In this test folder I have included three examples to run and test REACT. The three examples contain their corresponding JSON input file ready to be run.

Test1 containing Example1: this test is for a network of 4 variables that includes as input:
(1) two wild type time series
(2) three single-knockout time series
(3) One priorModel, that is, one seeding polynomial dynamical system obtained after running BasicReveng
(4) priorReverseEngineeringNetwork, that is, the wiring diagram obtained from previously applying the MinSets reverse engineering method.
(5) priorBiologicalNetwork, that is, prior information about the wiring diagram. This I just invented it.
(6) The corresponding sets of arguments for the aforementioned input data.

Test 2 containing Example2: this test is for a network of 8 variables that includes as input:
(1) two wild type time series
(2) The corresponding sets of arguments for the aforementioned input data.

Test 3 containing Example3: this test is for a network of 4 variables that includes as input:
(1) two wild type time series
(2) three single-knockout time series
(3) Two priorModels, that is, two seeding polynomial dynamical system obtained after running BasicReveng
(4) priorReverseEngineeringNetwork, that is, the wiring diagram obtained from previously applying the MinSets reverse engineering method.
(5) priorBiologicalNetwork, that is, prior information about the wiring diagram. This I just invented it.
(6) The corresponding sets of arguments for the aforementioned input data.
