Brief description
===========================

"NetReduction" is a program that reduces an AND-NOT boolean network
For detailed description of the methods and reduction
algorithms please refer to:

A. Veliz-Cuba and R. Laubenbacher. Reduction of Boolean models 
through AND-NOT logic representation.

System Requirements
==================================================================

   -- technically any Unix system
   -- gcc and g++ compilers 
   -- make
   -- Boost Graph Library

============
Installation 
============

- Install Boost Library. 
- g++ -O3 -I $BOOST NetReduction.cpp -o NetReduction 
  where $BOOST is the directory in which the Boost files are located
  for example in my case $BOOST = /home/boris/TOOLS/boost_1_49_0 

=================
Details of usage
=================

The Boolean network should be specified in a file
with the following formats

first line : number of nodes, second Line : number of edges
The rest of the lines should specify the edges, one edge per line
Edges are specified by three columns
the first is the source node, the second column is the target node 
and the third column is the sign of the edge

See the file adjmatrix.txt for an example.

To reduce your network use the following pattern 

./NetReduction -i inputfile  -o outpufile 

Example:

./NetReduction -i adjmatrix.txt -o reduced.txt

the reduced matrix will be printed in reduced.txt
