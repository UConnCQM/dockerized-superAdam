INTRODUCTION

    BoolStuff is a small C++ library that supports a few operations on
    boolean expression binary trees. The main features are:

        - a boolean expression parser (supports operators AND, OR
          and NOT, as well as parentheses);

        - an algorithm to convert a boolean expression binary tree
          into its Disjunctive Normal Form;

        - a function that determines if an expression tree is in DNF.

    A command named `booldnf' that calls this library is also provided.

    See the BoolStuff Home Page:
    http://sarrazip.com/dev/boolstuff.html

    Manual pages (boolstuff.3 and booldnf.1) are provided.

INSTALLATION

    This package is autoconfiscated.  See INSTALL for details.
    The sequence `./configure --prefix=SOME_PREFIX; make; make
    install' should suffice.

USING THIS LIBRARY

    The `examples' subdirectory of this source archive contains
    an autoconfiscated example program that uses this library.
    It assumes that the library has been installed.

    There is also a Perl script (test-booldnf.pl) that shows how
    to call the `booldnf' command from a bidirectional pipe.
