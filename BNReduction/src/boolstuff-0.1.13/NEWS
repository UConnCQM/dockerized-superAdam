Version 0.1.13 - 2010-02-14

    Terms of DNF now sorted to eliminate duplicates.
    Fixed g++ 4.4.0 compilation errors.

Version 0.1.12 - 2008-10-13

    Fixed memory leaks.
    Fixed wrong result for "a&!a".
    BoolExprParser::Error::STRING_EXPECTED enumerated name renamed to
    IDENTIFIER_EXPECTED.
    Compilation fixes for gcc 4.3.
    AM_PROG_CC_C_O now used in configure.ac to avoid this warning:
	compiling `checkc.c' with per-target flags requires
	`AM_PROG_CC_C_O' in `configure.ac'

Version 0.1.11 - 2007-04-29

    Example programs are not installed anymore.

Version 0.1.10 - 2006-02-04

    DNF algorithm now detects cases where resulting expression tree
    would be too large (maximum number of tree nodes set to 10000).
    booldnf command now returns EXIT_FAILURE if one of the
    requested conversions fail.

Version 0.1.9 - 2005-05-08

    Fixed bug with input expression "!(!(a&m))".
    Removed support for quoted variable names in expression parser,
    to avoid having the BoolExpr<T> template depend on T being std::string.
    Fixes for problems when compiling with g++ 3.4.
    Documentation updated slightly and converted to Doxygen format.

Version 0.1.8 - 2003-03-18

    New booldnf command that converts expressions to the DNF.
    New Perl example in the `examples' subdirectory that uses this
    command with a bidirectional pipe.

Version 0.1.7 - 2003-03-11

    Method BoolExpr<T>::getTreeVariables() now wrapped in the C API
    by function boolstuff_get_tree_variables() and its companion
    boolstuff_free_variables_sets().  The checkc.c testing program
    has been updated accordingly.  It also builds a more complex
    expression to illustrate this addition.

Version 0.1.6 - 2002-12-13

    isDNFTermUseful() deleted.  The DNF is now automatically simplified
    to eliminate useless (always false) terms.  Some cases were deleted
    from test-cases.txt (e.g., a&!a) because they were returned as
    false statements.

    Better example program in the examples subdirectory.

Version 0.1.5 - 2002-12-12

    Fixes for g++ 3.2 compilation problems related to the C++
    std namespace.

Version 0.1.4 - 2002-12-12

    New methods to get the roots of the trees of the DNF terms
    and to determine if some DNF terms are useless (always false).
    New public methods to change the properties of an existing node.
    RPM .spec.in file fixed to disable dependency tracking, which allows
    compilation with g++ 2.95.3.
    Documentation slightly improved.

Version 0.1.3 - 2002-11-12

    Better way of linking the C test program with BoolStuff and libstdc++.
    Also, -lstdc++ not needed for g++ 3.0 after all...
    See <src/boolstuff/Makefile.am>.

Version 0.1.2 - 2002-11-08

    Linking problem solved for g++ 3.0.

Version 0.1.1 - 2002-11-07

    Compilation problems fixed for g++ 3.2.

Version 0.1.0 - 2002-11-06

    First public release.
    Versions 0.1.x will have an unstable API.
    Versions 1.0.x will have a stable API.
