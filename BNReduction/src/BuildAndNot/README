DESCRIPTION
----------

BuildAndNot is a small program to transform a 
general boolean network to and AND-NOT network.

INPUTS
------
A file with the boolean functions, see "network.dat"
as an example. we use "|", "&", and "!" for 
OR, AND, NOT respectively.

A variable identifier should
always follow after "!". So that functions
like !(x1|x2) are not allowed.

All the variables should start with "x" and 
then an identifier number is needed, for example
"x2" is the variable of the second node. The code uses
this notation otherwise the output will not make any sense.

If the network has "n" nodes only identifiers from 1 to n
are expected. This is because the algorithm creates new
variables and uses identifiers starting at n+1.



OUTPUT
------
The functions of the AND-NOT network will be
displayed in the screen.

si is a variable that is the the opposite of xi
si = !xi
